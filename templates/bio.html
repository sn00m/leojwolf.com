        <p id="bio">Leo Wolf is a musician/artist/programmer from Charlotte, North Carolina. 
            While better known for his work in the drone/ambient genre, Leo got his start 
            as a beatmaker under the alias Snoom, and developed a love for working with 
            samples and heavily effected sounds. Led by a mixture of curiousity, instinct, 
            and musical tastes, Leo began exploring deeper concepts of synthesis and sound design, 
            involving hardware samplers, tape machines, effects pedals, and modular analog gear.

            Taking inspiration from memories, time, reflections, the occult, and symbolism in 
            dreams, Leo seeks to form and refine connections between the physical and metaphysical 
            nature of existence. The labyrinth symbolizes that concept; the inner 
            existing in parallel to the outer and their inference of each other.

            Leo is the founder and curator of the drone and experimental label Dead Letters Archive,
            and co-founder of Sinetology, a Charlotte-based electronic music label and collective.
