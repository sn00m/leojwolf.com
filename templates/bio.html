        <p id="bio">Leo Wolf is a musician and artist from Charlotte, North Carolina. 
            While better known for his work in the drone/ambient genres, Leo got his start 
            making psychedelic beat music under the alias Snoom, and developed a love for 
            working with samples and heavily effected sounds. An exploratory instinct in his 
            approach to music led Leo towards deeper concepts of production and sound design, 
            involving modular analog gear to study various synthesis and sampling techniques.

            Taking inspiration from memories, time, reflections, and symbolism in dreams, 
            Leo seeks to form and refine connections between the physical and metaphysical 
            nature of existence. The labyrinth represents that concept of how the inner 
            exists in parallel to the outer.
