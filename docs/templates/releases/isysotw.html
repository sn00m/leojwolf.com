                    “I saw your shadow on the wall” is made up of nine recordings created using granular synthesis and effects
                    to process sampled material from classical records and field recordings. The processed sounds were then sequenced
                    and looped asynchronously to create a layered textural weave, both repetitive and interesting, hypnotic and bracing.

                    I wanted to explore the concept of identity, relying on my own memories and dreams, as well as ideas from some of my
                    favorite books.

                    While considering the themes, and how to represent them aesthetically in the music, I thought a lot about how we exist
                    in parallel realities, inner and outer, physical and metaphysical; and how they inform each other. Conjuring fractured
                    moments, people, objects, inextricably linked by their simultaneous symbolic and concrete natures. What is it to know 
                    a thing, yourself, or another, their shadows stretching and drifting? How do you navigate the twisting halls of memory?
                    At the center of the labyrinth is a mirror, a vessel for light and truth; a way of understanding our relationship with 
                    the world and all the forms god dreams in.
