                    "On a mountaintop; a wide and grassy plateau, surrounded by open air. Thick clouds floating overhead.
                    Near the edge, flowing red and white robes. They turn but their face is a blur. Muffled words hover in
                    the air, indecipherable. Wooden panels knocking against the cliffside, attached by hinges; red ribbons
                    streaming. Intricate patterns are carved in the wood. I trace the paths with my fingertips, like 
                    walking a labyrinth. Alone, listening to the wind."

                    'Shapeshifter' is a study of the subconscious. Conceptually, the album is inspired by a series of 
                    dreams that were recorded in a journal between 2013-2020. It consists of 6 textural drone tracks made
                    through granular synthesis. Every sound was sourced from vinyl records, films, and field recordings 
                    arranged and heavily processed, forming a distorted reflection of the source material; similar to the
                    way dreams reflect reality in another light. This is the overarching theme of 'Shapeshifter'; inner 
                    and outer worlds existing separately and in parallel, mirroring each other in different forms.
