        <p id="bio">Leo Wolf is an artist and engineer. His music combines synthesis with processed 
            samples, field recordings, and archival sounds to create hypnotic drones and textures. He 
            also explores visual art mediums such as monotype printmaking.

            <br>
            His work is heavily inspired by themes of memory, time, and dreams. In both the audio and 
            visual realms he investigates connections between the physical and metaphysical, the labyrinth 
            of inner and outer realms that consistute our lived experiences.
