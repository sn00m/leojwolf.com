        <p id="bio">Leo Wolf is a musician, artist, and programmer from Charlotte, North Carolina. 
            Getting his start in music as a beatmaker under the alias SNOOM, Leo developed a love 
            for working with samples and heavily effected sounds. Mainly driven by curiosity, and 
            evolving musical taste, he began a deeper exploration of synthesis concepts and sound 
            design, ultimately led to recording and performing more experimental forms of music.

            His work in both the audio and visual realms seeks to investigate, form, and refine 
            connections between physical and metaphysical, from the view point of nature as a paradox 
            between the inner and outer realms in which we exist. Memories, time, and symbolism in 
            dreams serve as common seeds of inspiration for these investigations to grow from.

            Leo is the founder and curator of the drone and experimental label Dead Letters Archive,
            and co-founder of Sinetology, a Charlotte-based electronic music label and collective
            with a focus on hardware and live events.
