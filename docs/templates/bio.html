        <p id="bio">Leo Wolf is a sound artist, musician, audio engineer, programmer, visual artist.
            His music combines synthesis with heavily processed samples, field recordings, and archival
            sounds to create hypnotic drones and textures, and is inspired by themes of memory, time,
            and dreams. His most recent interest is in creating works for spatial sound. He also 
            explores physical art mediums such as monotype printmaking, and drawing.

            His work in both the audio and visual realms seeks to investigate, form, and refine 
            connections between the physical and metaphysical, viewing nature as a paradox 
            between the inner and outer realms in which we exist. Memories, time, and symbolism in 
            dreams serve as common sources of inspiration for these investigations.
